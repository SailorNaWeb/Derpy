- Discord Enriched Rich Presence (YAYY)

This is a project of a local application that will handle data received in a especific port and then use it to display in form of Rich Presence inside of discord.

I'll be using the *deprecated* old version of discord rich presence sdk, because the new one has too much bullshit to begin using it ans this is a small scale project.
